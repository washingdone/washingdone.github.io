    <p>This site was developed by me and a partner in roughly 6.5 hours during the 2018 SkillsUSA National Web Design and Development Competition. We met with a mock client who gave us a description of the ficticious band we were creating a website for. Text, audio, and some of the images used were provided to us as well as a barebones wireframe. A sizeable selection of the Google Fonts database and the waveplayer.js (with documentation) were also provided. No outside internet access was allowed. This version of the site was imported directly from our <span style="text-color: #FFD700;">gold medal</span> winning submitted product to this repo. The only modifications made were this notice and link pathing. If the API for this page goes down the javascript may be edited to include the data, otherwise no alterations will be made to the rest of this page.</p>
