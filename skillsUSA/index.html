    <p>This site was developed by me and a partner in roughly 6.5 hours during the 2018 SkillsUSA National Web Design and Development Competition. We met with a mock client who gave us a description of the ficticious band we were creating a website for. Text, audio, and some of the images used were provided to us as well as a barebones wireframe. A sizeable selection of the Google Fonts database and the waveplayer.js (with documentation) were also provided. No outside internet access was allowed. This version of the site was imported directly from our submitted product to this repo. The only modifications made were this notice and link pathing. No alterations will be made to the rest of this page.</p>

            <p>Born of down-home country folk. Blended with Heartland Jazz. Soaked in Delta Blues.</p>
            <p>Nathan Taylor & Friends explode with rich sound and purely blended talent. This talent is bathed in a wide range of vintage American blues & roots music, born of the soul of the heartland and the most fortunate front porches of Canton, Illinois.</p>
            <p>From classic roots songs and blues of the delta to early New Orleans jazz and Nathan Taylor originals, their audiences dance  to soulful spins on the old styles mixed with new music  as they are transported to simpler times, past and present.</p>
